            This is a back up 


          I in the last four months of 2014 i got angry because they did not let me register a matter co-requirement and therefore I was going to delaying a semester and i got very angry ... in the first quarter of this year perform 1 matter because i atrazaron ... and he was still angry. At the end of the first semester I opened the opportunity to enter the ina and remove the technical English, but was all the days to the 2-5, and I prayed and i told God that if it was the will of the, then, that I don't crash into the u and the ina.
          Ina is a college.


          And what could complete all .... but in the second quarter (which I just finished) perform many materials and only at night. ... And I am shocked not nothing and pass everything ... and this semester that i have now only at night is and ina in the afternoon. ... Nothing strikes me .... But if in 2014 i had no longer carry the materials that i wanted to never have been able to study in the ina. I promised and i wrote in my little notebook that special point who was to testify of this if everything went well..
           

          I wrote on 3/05/2015 ... I am going to testify with my title in the church. ... I promise ... everything that happens ... i promise ... and I came to my mind this phrase: The pain that step and we could bear it is the greatest satisfaction and motivation to achieve what we want.. I am going to graduate ... i'm not going to be. ... I'm going to achieve ..... And when I read what I wrote in this complicated time because it wasn't easy ...... I can only say. ... You are the best Jesus.

          Jesus you are the best
